Choose a regression dataset
Task:-
select regression
numerical dataset

make a pairplot(gives linear relation between all columns)

Find features which has more relation with the target column

Implement Least square method

Draw the regression line

Train and Test the data

make a separate plot with the test sample

Find the MSE for the regression

and finally use the library function of linear regression and compare it with manually plotted line

Use relevant metrics like MAE,MSE,R2 values
